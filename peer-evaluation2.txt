Project: Text Adventure
Peer's repository: https://github.com/scarletmanatee/03-Text-adventure.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project? 
I learnt that you can have more than one verb that leads to the same map allowing for synonyms to be used when someone is playing the game.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
Have a good story that has many rooms, mine was quite short and I would have liked to have more things to do in my game.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
Maybe you could utilise the inventory system, that would add a new dimension to the game.

What could have been clearer or better commented?
Although not necessary, maybe some comments in the json file would be useful to better explain each room and where they all lie relatively. 
 
Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Sometimes the NoExit target in the json file would lead to some confusing outputs, but mostly the code was well written and based off the framework provided.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Maybe explain the situation more since the reeder doesn't know what 'my house ' is.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
Your rooms seem really well planned out and connected, makes the game way more interesting.
